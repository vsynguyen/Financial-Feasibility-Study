# Financial Feasibility Study
In this project, I utilized data from Venture Capital Investment Data (source: Kaggle), which
includes venture capital investments in startup projects. My goal was to analyze the financial
considerations of these projects and calculate the Return on Investment (ROI). 

By using analytical tools such as Python and Power BI, I conducted in-depth analyzes of various
investment factors, such as the investment amount, payback period, and growth potential of the
startups. The results from this study help identify the risk levels and profitability of each
project, providing critical data to support venture capital investment decisions.
